### Intro
GitHub Actions are a powerful feature that allows developers to automate various workflows related to software development and deployment. Here are some reasons why GitHub Actions are needed:

1. Automation: GitHub Actions allows developers to automate various tasks related to software development, such as building and testing code, deploying applications, and creating release packages.
    
2. Collaboration: GitHub Actions allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and work on different tasks simultaneously. Actions can be used to create workflows that automate tasks for each developer, allowing them to focus on their respective work.
    
3. Efficiency: GitHub Actions enables developers to streamline their workflow and eliminate manual tasks, which saves time and improves productivity.
    
4. Customization: GitHub Actions is highly customizable and can be tailored to suit individual project needs. Developers can create their custom actions or use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace.
    
5. Integration: GitHub Actions can integrate with other tools and services such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Slack, making it easier to build, test, and deploy applications.
    

Overall, GitHub Actions provide an easy and efficient way to automate various aspects of software development, saving time and improving collaboration between developers.


### Github Actions Workflow Ruby to Github Pages Jekyll

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the process of building and deploying a static site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` or `master` branches of a repository. It utilizes various actions available on the GitHub Marketplace to perform different tasks such as checking out the repository, setting up environment, building the site, testing it, and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

Let's break down the workflow step by step:

1. **Workflow Name and Trigger:**

```yaml
name: "Build and Deploy" 
	on:   
		push:     
			branches:       
				- main       
				- master     
			paths-ignore:
				- .gitignore       
				- README.md       
				- LICENSE   
		workflow_dispatch:
```
    
 - This workflow is named "Build and Deploy".
- It is triggered on every push to the `main` or `master` branches.
- It ignores changes to certain files like `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`.
- It also allows manual triggering from the GitHub Actions tab using "workflow_dispatch".

2. **Permissions and Concurrency:**

```yaml
permissions:   
	contents: read  
	pages: write   
	id-token: write  
concurrency:   
	group: "pages"   
	cancel-in-progress: true
```

- The workflow specifies certain permissions and concurrency settings.
- It grants read access to contents, write access to GitHub Pages, and write access to id tokens.
- It limits concurrency to a group named "pages" and allows canceling in-progress deployments.

3. **Jobs:**
    
```yaml
jobs:   
	build:     
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest     
		steps:       
			# ... build steps    
	deploy:     
		environment:       
			name: github-pages       
			url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}     
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest     
		needs: build     
		steps:       
			# ... deployment steps
```
    
- The workflow defines two jobs: `build` and `deploy`.
- The `build` job runs on an Ubuntu environment.
- The `deploy` job also runs on Ubuntu and depends on the completion of the `build` job.
- An environment named "github-pages" is defined for the `deploy` job, and the URL where the site will be deployed is stored in `url`.

3. **Steps in the `build` Job:**
    
```yaml
steps:   
	- name: Checkout     
	  uses: actions/checkout@v3     
		  # ...    
	- name: Setup Pages     
		id: pages     
		uses: actions/configure-pages@v3     
		# ...    
	- name: Setup Ruby     
		uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1     
		# ...    
	- name: Build site     
		run: bundle exec jekyll b -d "_site${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"     
		env:       
			JEKYLL_ENV: "production"     
			# ...    
	- name: Test site     
	  run: |   
	  bundle exec htmlproofer _site --disable-external --check-html --allow_hash_href     
	  # ...    
	- name: Upload site artifact     
	  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1     
	  # ...
```
    
- These steps are executed in the `build` job.
- The steps include checking out the repository, setting up GitHub Pages, configuring Ruby environment, building the site using Jekyll, testing the site with HTMLProofer, and uploading the site artifact.
- **significations explain:**
	1. **Checkout**: The `actions/checkout` action is used to clone the repository content into the runner environment. This action checks out the latest commit on the specified branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and makes it available for further steps.
    
	2. **Setup Pages**: The `actions/configure-pages` action is used to configure settings related to GitHub Pages. The `id: pages` allows you to refer to the outputs of this step later in the workflow. This step helps in setting up necessary configurations for GitHub Pages deployment.
    
	3. **Setup Ruby**: The `ruby/setup-ruby` action is used to set up the Ruby environment. In this case, it sets up the Ruby version defined as `ruby-version: 3`. It also indicates that the Bundler cache should be utilized (`bundler-cache: true`), which can speed up the installation of Ruby gems.
    
	4. **Build site (Jekyll)**: The `run` step here executes the command `bundle exec jekyll b -d "_site${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"`. This command uses Jekyll, a static site generator, to build the site. The `-d` flag specifies the output directory. The value `${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}` retrieves the base path from the outputs of the previous `Setup Pages` step.
    
    Additionally, the `env` section sets the environment variable `JEKYLL_ENV` to `"production"`, which might be used by Jekyll to configure the build for a production environment.
    
	5. **Test site**: This step runs a shell script that uses `bundle exec htmlproofer` to test the generated site. HTMLProofer is a tool used to validate HTML documents and check links. The script disables checks for external links (`--disable-external`), checks HTML validity (`--check-html`), and allows hash-based URLs (`--allow_hash_href`).
    
	6. **Upload site artifact**: The `actions/upload-pages-artifact` action is used to upload the generated site as an artifact. This step makes it possible to store the built site as a downloadable artifact associated with the GitHub Actions run. Users can access this artifact after the workflow has completed.
    

		Each step is a self-contained action that contributes to the overall process of building the site and preparing it for deployment. The actions are executed in sequence, and the information or artifacts produced by one step can be used by subsequent steps. This modular approach allows for flexibility and ease of maintenance when setting up complex workflows. 

4. **Steps in the `deploy` Job:**
   
```yaml
steps:   
	- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages     
	  id: deployment     
	  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2     
	  # ...
```
    
- The `deploy` job contains a single step to deploy the site using the `actions/deploy-pages@v2` action.
- The URL of the deployed site is stored in the `page_url` output variable of the `deployment` step.


	This workflow combines various GitHub Actions to automate the process of building and deploying a static site to GitHub Pages. It leverages actions such as `actions/checkout`, `actions/configure-pages`, `ruby/setup-ruby`, and others to perform specific tasks at different stages of the deployment process. It's important to have a solid understanding of these actions and how they fit together to tailor this workflow to your specific project's needs.
